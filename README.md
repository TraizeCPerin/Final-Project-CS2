# 📌 Project Proposal (Draft)

## 📝 Project Title 
*Enter your initial project title here.*  

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement  
What real-world problem does your project want to solve?  
- Describe the issue or need you identified.  
- Explain why this problem is relevant and worth solving.  
- Relate the problem to the dataset you selected (e.g., hospital, ecommerce, students, etc.).  

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives  
Write at least **2–3 clear objectives** your project aims to achieve. Example:  
- Objective 1: To analyze and summarize data from the chosen JSON dataset.  
- Objective 2: To help users gain meaningful insights (e.g., averages, trends, patterns).  
- Objective 3: To practice JSON handling and Python programming concepts.  

---

## ⚙️ Planned Features  
Your program must have **at least 5 features (minimum)**.  
We have provided **2 starter ideas** for each dataset — you must design **at least 3 additional features**.  

- Feature 1: Find the maximum height
- Feature 2: Compute the total horizontal distance covered
- Feature 3: find displacement
- Feature 4: find final position
- Feature 5: compute for the time

*(You may add more features if you like.)*

## ⌨️ Planned Inputs and Outputs  

- **Inputs**  
  - Scenario ID
  - x0 (initial x-position)
  - y0 (initial y-position)
  - v0 (initial velocity)
  - angle_deg
  - g (acceleration due to gravity)
    
- **Outputs**  
  - average velocity
  - acceleration due to gravity
  - maximum height reeached
  - total horizontal range
  - comparison results (which projectile traveled farther/higher)

## 🧠 Logic Plan  
Choose **ONE** way to describe your program’s logic:  

### Option 1: Pseudocode  
Write your steps in plain English. Example:  
Load JSON file
Display menu of features
If user chooses "1", compute average grade per student
If user chooses "2", list all borrowed books
Repeat until user exits program


### Option 2: Flowchart  
Attach or draw a flowchart showing how the program will work.
